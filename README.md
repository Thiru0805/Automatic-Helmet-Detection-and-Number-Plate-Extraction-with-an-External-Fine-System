# Automatic-Helmet-Detection-and-Number-Plate-Extraction-with-an-External-Fine-System
This project presents the development of an automated system aimed at improving road safety and enforcing traffic regulations through the integration of advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The primary objectives of this system are to detect whether bike riders are wearing helmets and to recognize and extract number plate information for identification and enforcement purposes.The system begins by accepting input in the form of video files, which are processed into individual frames using OpenCV.
TensorFlow and Keras are employed for deep learning-based helmet detection, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to identify helmet-wearing behavior accurately. Frames with riders wearing helmets are automatically skipped, optimizing processing time and resources.For frames where riders are not wearing helmets, the system utilizes advanced
image processing algorithms to perform number plate recognition.OpenCV-based techniques such as contour detection, image segmentation, andcharacter recognition are employed to extract the number plate information accurately. The recognized number plates are saved in a designated folder forfurther processing.In addition to the real-time detection and recognition
capabilities, the system integrates with an Excel database containing bike rider details, including license plate numbers and personal information. When a number plate is successfully recognized, the system retrieves the corresponding rider details from the database and facilitates the issuance of fines or other regulatory actions as needed.The user interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly experience for interacting with the system. The interface allows users to upload video files, monitor the detection and recognition processes, and view the captured number plate information along with relevant rider details.This project contributes significantly to road safety initiatives by leveraging
cutting-edge technologies to ensure helmet compliance among bike riders and to enforce traffic regulations through accurate number plate recognition and data management. Future enhancements may include real-time integration with traffic monitoring systems and the implementation of automated fine generationmechanisms for streamlined enforcement processes.
